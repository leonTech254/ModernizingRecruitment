Garden Estate with a high rate of unemployment. The school has a diverse student population,
with students from different socio-economic backgrounds. Due to limited resources, the school
often struggles to attract and retain qualified teachers, which has a direct impact on the quality of
education that students receive. The size of the school is two-storey building not that big.
The recruitment process for Vemona Primary School has traditionally been conducted
manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. A web-based recruitment portal could
simplify and streamline this process, making it easier to find qualified candidates for various
position at the school. Additionally, it could provide a centralized platform for job seekers to
apply for these positions, and for the school to manage the recruitment process efficiently.`,vision:"Venoma Primary School aims to foster a dynamic learning environment where every child is inspired, empowered, and equipped with the knowledge, skills, and values to thrive in a rapidly changing world.
